UILazyImageView
===============

A simple override of the normal UIImageView to load and image asynchronously with a progress bar. It uses HTTP native iOS caché system as well as implemented caché using the tmp folder to store the already downloaded images. It can be used in table views as well. The code comes with two examples, one table view with big jpg images from google and another view with a single image view to test.
